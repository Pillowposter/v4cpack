This pack is a "Just for Fun" project created by
SuperJustinBros for Sonic Robo Blast 2 Kart (SRB2Kart).

The characters are edited to have darker outlines, tire shines, and the
ability to change palettes using one of the 89 available colors.
Otherwise all the original spritework is retained for authenticity. Some
characters are given different preferred colors from what they normally
use in Super Mario Kart.
(seriously, do we need three Red-color racers and four
Emerald-color racers?)

Mario: Red (unchanged)
Luigi: Emerald -> Swamp
Princess: Raspberry (unchanged)
Yoshi: Emerald (unchganged)
Bowser: Emerald -> Green
Donkey Kong Jr.: Red -> Rosewood
Toad: Red -> Ruby
Koopa Troopa: Emerald -> Pinetree

The four weight groups are given stats that are a close approximation
of their Super Mario Kart counterparts, excluding the acceleration-class
racers (Princess and Yoshi), who are slower in order to keep them
acceleration-focused but handle better to keep their weights balanced.

This pack contains several additional racers not part of the
"Original eight" done in Super Mario Kart style. Some were edited
to fix issues with the original spritework, minor or major.

Bowser Jr. by Devicho
Daisy by EdpR (with minor edits)
Diddy Kong by Clutch
Donkey Kong by Toni (with new steering sprite)
Shy Guy by NICKtendo DS
Waluigi by PurpleEggplant (with major edits)
Wario by Frario

All characters use Mario Kart 64 voices or voices from the
Nintendo 64/early Gamecube era.
